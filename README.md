# Repl.it Mobile

A mobile client for the online coding platform and community [Repl.it](https://repl.it/). **This is a work in progress, [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/sVxJJZA) if you're interested!**

If you want to try it out, I will sometimes be hosting a "tunnel." If you want to access this, download the [Expo mobile app](https://expo.io/tools#client) and open [mobile.repl.co](https://mobile.repl.co/) on your phone.
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/kognise/repl.it-mobile)](https://repl.it/github/kognise/repl.it-mobile)

If you're on Android and want to test out a more stable build, you can download that [here](https://mobile.repl.co/download.html).

## Motivation

Repl.it is amazing but the site isn't very mobile friendly. This app's development will enable programmers to edit code on the go, and empower students who only have access to tablets or phones to learn how to program.

## Development

- Clone this repository or pull the latest changes
- Make sure to run `yarn` to install packages
- Install the [Expo mobile app](https://expo.io/tools#client)
- Run `yarn dev` to start a development server
- On your phone scan the QR code or enter in the address
